        <h1>Hello ChocoLand!</h1>
        <!-- This is a poen for my love Nellyne -->
        <p>In the <em>quiet</em> of the night, a whispering breeze,
            A gentle rustling through the trees.
            Stars above, twinkling bright,
            Painting the sky with their soft light.</p>

        <p> In my heart, a flutter, a sigh,
            As dreams of you float by.
            A moment frozen in time's embrace,
            A fleeting glimpse of your beauty and grace..</p>

        <p>The world sleeps, wrapped in peace,
            As your presence brings a sense of release.
            In the <em>darkness</em>, your light shines,
            A beacon of love that forever aligns.</p>
        
        <p>So let us pause, let us listen,
            To the love in our hearts, a timeless mission.
            In the <strong>stillness</strong>, I find my way,
            Guided by your love, night and day.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>I love you for your laughter, so pure and bright,
            For the way you light up even the darkest night.
            I love you for your kindness, so gentle and true,
            For the way you always know just what to do.</p>
        <p>I love you for your strength, so quiet yet strong,
            For the way you've faced challenges all along.
            I love you for your passion, so fierce and bold,
            For the way you chase your dreams, untold.</p>
        <p>I love you for your beauty, inside and out,
            For the way you make my heart want to shout.
            I love you for your love, so deep and pure,
            For the way you make my life feel so sure.</p>
        <p>I love you for your quirks, your little ways,
            For the way you brighten all my days.
            I love you for being you, in every single part,
            For the way you've captured my whole heart.</p>
        <p>I love you for all that you are, and all that you'll be,
            For the way you've made my life complete, you see.
            I'll keep loving you for eternity, my dear,
            For the way you've made everything so clear.</p>
